In this assignment, I created a snake with a random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain, and the snake also has links with and without sensors colored as green and blue, respectively.

Each time "button.py" is ran, a randomized snake is created and simulated. This specific program finds a random number between 3 and 15 to determin the length of the snake, and then each link has a 50% chance of having a sensor. Each sensor is connected to every motor for a full neural network.
